# Northwind Sales & Operations Insight (Advanced SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of the **Northwind** database, a classic retail and supply chain dataset. 
I performed deep-dive analytics to solve business-oriented problems regarding sales trends, logistics, and customer segmentation using **PostgreSQL**.

## 🚀 Key Features & SQL Techniques
This project demonstrates proficiency in advanced SQL topics:
* **Complex Data Aggregations:** Joining 5+ tables to link products, categories, suppliers, and regions.
* **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Modularizing code for readability and complex logic.
* **Window Functions:**
    * `RANK` & `DENSE_RANK` for performance leaderboards.
    * `LAG` for Month-over-Month growth analysis.
    * `NTILE` for customer value segmentation.
    * `AVG() OVER()` for benchmarking logistics.
* **Advanced Logic:** Using `CASE WHEN` to categorize delivery speeds and Type Casting `(::numeric)` for precise calculations.
